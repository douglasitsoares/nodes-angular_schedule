Project Schedule System

Background : This application is a type for schedule services for many businness as needed to have a type of agenda control 
	The idea is simplify the service and organize handle in each duty simple as seens

001_Implementation Schedule, details of this first changed below:
	Create a MongoDB 
		- tbl_schedule
			- id (key natural by collection)
			- service
			- details
			- imagePath
			- date
			- time
			- creator
	Just it for first steps to simplify the application to grown up for many acomplishments

	* Change Backend ( {
		- Models, create one new schedule just increments another fields based on posts models 
		- Controllers, create a new schedule
		- Routes, create a new schedule and configure information of end points
		- App add schedule in use routes backend 
		
		>> Result after this changed the program run backend and front end without information of schedule 
			as expected once not exists no information for that
		****Error Mongo was an error to create directly in AtlasMongo than I create using the command below 
			>> //scheduleSchema.index({ service: 1, details: 1 }); and rename code model name

	* Change FrontEnd
		- schedule.models
		- schedule list
		- schedule service
		
		>> Result after many attempts the basic of shedulist is working without errors, continued to working on the create
		new schedule by forms anyway the process continues
		
		- schedule create >> was generated basic input working as expected changing routes and others configurations
		good experience to go ahead to another changes on the system application commit >>002_scheduleCreate
