TOKEN GitHub : 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

Background : This application is a type for schedule services for many businness as needed to have a type of agenda control 
	The idea is simplify the service and organize handle in each duty simple as seens

001_Implementation Schedule, details of this first changed below:
	Create a MongoDB 
		- tbl_schedule
			- id (key natural by collection)
			- service
			- details
			- imagePath
			- date
			- time
			- creator
	Just it for first steps to simplify the application to grown up for many acomplishments

	* Change Backend ( {
		- Models, create one new schedule just increments another fields based on posts models 
		- Controllers, create a new schedule
		- Routes, create a new schedule and configure information of end points
		- App add schedule in use routes backend 
		
		>> Result after this changed the program run backend and front end without information of schedule 
			as expected once not exists no information for that
		****Error Mongo was an error to create directly in AtlasMongo than I create using the command below 
			>> //scheduleSchema.index({ service: 1, details: 1 }); and rename code model name

	* Change FrontEnd
		- schedule.models
		- schedule list
		- schedule service
		
		>> Result after many attempts the basic of shedulist is working without errors, continued to working on the create
		new schedule by forms anyway the process continues
		
		- schedule create >> was generated basic input working as expected changing routes and others configurations
		good experience to go ahead to another changes on the system application commit >>002_scheduleCreate
		
		-schedule edit >> this module needs to change to edit schedule or just cancel it.
			* change app-routing
			* change schedule list html to navigate right schedule/edit
		- schedule delete >> works fine

		- Insert Header Icon for choices >> this implementation covered the choice of functionality in app needs to navigation
		as safely on software 
		- Default Assignments (Login and Signup)
		- Home screen initial to show when the first time on app
		*** Works with more useful requirements
		- Putting Date on datepicker, changes
			* schedule.create html
			* schedule models
			
		- Backend
			* models

		Sugestion : Increments List Schedule, after put date picker and filter to hour increments it to have a nice knowledge
